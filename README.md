```
-i <input file>: To specify the input apk file,
-o <output file>: To specify the output file,
-b: To specify the task as analyzing the task unboundedness problem,
-r <reach file>ï¼š To specify the task as analyzing the configuration reachability problem, use reach file to describe the configurations to analyze,
-e {nfa|nuxmv}: To specify the engine for analyzing the configuration reachability problem,
-h <height>: To set the bound of the height of stack, the default value is 6,
-k <number>: To set the bound of the number of tasks, the default value is 2,
-t <timeout>: To set the timeout, the default value is 300.
